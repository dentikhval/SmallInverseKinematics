# SmallInverseKinematics
Based on the open source project of the 6DoF robot arm based on stepper motors by Skyentific

Not building his arm, but using his code to extract inverse kinematics math in the way I want it: 
Denavit-Hartenberg parameters as input, XYZ cartesian position with ZYZ euler angles as input, joint angles as output.

I have yet to see some other implementation that is as simple and readable as Skyentific made it, all credits go to him.
